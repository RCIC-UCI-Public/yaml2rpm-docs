YAML2RPM Documentation
======================

**YAML2RPM** was developed at the Research Cyberinfrastructure Center (RCIC)
at the University of California, Irvine.

**YAML2RPM** is s a Generic Methodology for building RPMs and for managing 
the multiple versions, dependencies, and other details of a resilient software deployment.

The documentation will describe the process, point out many advantages and describe many examples in detail.
Our approach makes building and  packaging of applications very straightforward and reduces complex or 
difficult builds to manageable ones. 

**YAML2RPM** and our recipes for building hundreds of applications are open source
and are available from our :term:`github home` repositories.
