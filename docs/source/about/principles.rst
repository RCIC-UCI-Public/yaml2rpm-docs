Principles 
===========

The main principles are:

1. Use existing packaging system for a given OS
   including dependency resolution 
2. Small code base
3. Human-readable  terse package definition files
4. Package definition reuse as much as possible
5. Scalability - ability to build many package and many versions of packages
   with a very small personnel cost
6. Simultaneous installation of multiple versions of the same software
   with environment modules for a runtime selection.
